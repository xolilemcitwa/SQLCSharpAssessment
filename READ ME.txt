ISSUES
I couldn't do this assessment properly as my laptop broke down.
This is what I've managed to put together using my cellphone.


SQL
Run the script pr_GetOrderSummary.sql

API
Check the code in Roulette.API, I didn't compile.
I put the files there just to show how I would start coding this API using .NET 6 and Entity Framework.
